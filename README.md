# particleFilterDocker
A project where I explore react, node, postgresql and docker

download the zip file and unpack. then read the instruktioner.txt file


As I explored concepts and tried different ideas the code is in of some refactoring, to put it mildly.
It will not break your brain, but it will make you sad.
